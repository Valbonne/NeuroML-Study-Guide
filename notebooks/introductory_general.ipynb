    "Machine learning is the science of using computer to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "The basic idea behind machine learning is to build algorithms based on statistical analysis that takes input data and predict an output value or response. In order to create a model we have to chose type of model that fits to our problem and subsequently we **train** the model using **training data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of ML algorithms: **supervised** and **unsupervised**. \n",
    "**Supervised algorithms**  require both input and known output during the process of training. Once training is completed, the model can be used to a new dataset to predict outcome.\n",
    "**Unsupervised algorithms** do not require output in the process of training, they are used to discover pattern in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second main distinction between models is related to type of output. Your output can take **continuous** values, e.g., house price, IQ score, or can take **categorical** values, e.g. spam or not spam email, malignant or benign tumor.\n",
